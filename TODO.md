# TODOS
_A list of some in progress work. Used for very lightweight task tracking. I make no garuntees about this content being up to date or accurate._

- [ ] figure out way to do basic integration tests with a bash script
- [ ] come up with a pattern for unit testing by using pre-processor directives? or something?
- [ ] try using a function to create formatted strings for the help text rather than just directly printing to std out
- [ ] try using valgrind just to see what it says! I have no idea what valgrind does, but it'd be interesting to give it a shot
